### Controls

There are no user controls for this animation. Simply run the program to view the animation.

### Techniques Used

- **Rotation Matrices**: Employed rotation matrices for rotating the torus along the x and z axes, creating the animation effect.
- **Z-Buffering**: Utilized a Z-buffer to ensure correct depth ordering of the torus points, preventing rendering artifacts.
- **ASCII Art**: Used ASCII characters to represent the torus and achieve the visual effect.
- **Terminal Manipulation**: Employed terminal escape sequences to hide the cursor and manipulate terminal output for a smoother animation experience.
